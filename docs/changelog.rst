2.0.0 (2019-12-03)
==================

Dependency Changes
------------------

* Drop official Python 3.4 and 3.5 support
* Bump the pika requirement to 1.0.1+
* New dependency: `Crochet <https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_


API Changes
-----------

* Move all APIs to use the Twisted-managed connection. There are a few minor
  changes here which slightly change the APIs:

  1. Publishing now raises a PublishTimeout when the timeout is reached
     (30 seconds by default).
  2. Previously, the Twisted consume API did not validate arguments like
     the synchronous version did, so it now raises a ValueError on invalid
     arguments instead of crashing in some undefined way.
  3. Calling publish from the Twisted reactor thread now raises an
     exception instead of blocking the reactor thread.
  4. Consumer exceptions are not re-raised as ``HaltConsumer`` exceptions
     anymore, the original exception bubbles up and has to be handled by the
     application.


Features
--------

* The ``fedora-messaging`` cli now has 2 new sub-commands: ``publish`` and ``record``.
  (`PR#43 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/43>`_)
* Log the failure traceback on connection ready failures.


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix an issue where reconnection to the server would fail.
  (`#208 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/208>`_)
* Don't declare exchanges when consuming.
  (`#171 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/171>`_)
* Fix Twisted legacy logging (it does not accept format parameters).
* Handle ConnectionLost errors in the v2 Factory.


Development Changes
-------------------

* Many Twisted-related tests were added.
* Include tests for sample schema package.
* Update the dumps and loads functions for a new message format.


Documentation Improvements
--------------------------

* Document that logging is only set up for consumers.
* Update the six intersphinx URL to fix the docs build.
* Add the "conf" and "DEFAULTS" variables to the API documentation.
* Update example config: extra properties, logging.
* Document a quick way to setup logging.
* Document the sent-at header in messages.
* Create a quick-start guide.
* Clarify queues are only deleted if unused.

v1.7.1 (2019-06-24)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Don't declare exchanges when consuming using the synchronous
  :func:`fedora_messaging.api.consume` API, which was causing consuming to fail
  from the Fedora broker
  (`PR#191 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/191>`_)

  in the fedora.toml and stg.fedora.toml configuration files
  (`PR#188 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/188>`_)

* Document how to setup logging in the consuming snippets so any problems are
  logged to stdout
  (`PR#192 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/192>`_)

v1.7.0 (2019-05-21)
===================

Features
--------

* "fedora-messaging consume" now accepts a "--callback-file" argument which will
  load a callback function from an arbitrary Python file. Previously, it was
  required that the callback be in the Python path
  (`#159 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/159>`_).


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix a bug where publishes that failed due to certain connection errors were not
  retried
  (`#175 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/175>`_).

* Fix a bug where AMQP protocol errors did not reset the connection used for
  publishing messages. This would result in publishes always failing with a
  ConnectionError
  (`#178 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/178>`_).


Documentation Improvements
--------------------------

* Document the ``body`` attribute on the ``Message`` class
  (`#164 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/164>`_).

* Clearly document what properties message schema classes should override

v1.6.1 (2019-04-17)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix a bug in publishing where if the broker closed the connection, the client
  would not properly dispose of the connection object and publishing would fail
  forever (`PR#157 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/157>`_).

* Fix a bug in the :func:`fedora_messaging.api.twisted_consume` function where
  if the user did not have permissions to read from the specified queue which
  had already been declared, the Deferred that was returned never fired. It now
  errors back with a :class:`fedora_messaging.exceptions.PermissionException`
  (`PR#160 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/160>`_).


Development Changes
-------------------

v1.6.0 (2019-04-04)
===================

Dependency Changes
------------------

* Twisted is no longer an optional dependency: fedora-messaging requires Twisted
  12.2 or greater.

Features
--------

* A new API, :func:`fedora_messaging.api.twisted_consume`, has been added to
  support consuming using the popular async framework Twisted. The
  fedora-messaging command-line interface has been switched to use this API. As
  a result, Twisted 12.2+ is now a dependency of fedora-messsaging. Users of
  this new API are not affected by `Issue #130
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/130>`_ (`PR#139
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/139>`_).

Bug Fixes
---------

* Only prepend the topic_prefix on outgoing messages. Previously, the topic
  prefix was incorrectly applied to incoming messages (`#143
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/143>`_).

Documentation
-------------

* Add a note to the tutorial on how to instal the library and RabbitMQ in
  containers (`PR#141
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/141>`_).

* Document how to access the Fedora message broker from outside the Fedora
  infrastructure VPN. Users of fedmsg can now migrate to fedora-messaging for
  consumers outside Fedora's infrastructure. Consult the new documentation at
  :ref:`fedora-broker` for details (`PR#149
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/149>`_).

  (`#136 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/136>`_).


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix a bug in the sample schema pachage
  (`#135 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/135>`_).

v1.2.0 (2019-01-21)
===================

Features
--------

* The :func:`fedora_messaging.api.consume` API now accepts a "queues" keyword
  which specifies the queues to declare and consume from, and the
  "fedora-messaging" CLI makes use of this
  (`PR#107 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/107>`_)

* Utilities were added in the :py:mod:`schema_utils` module to help write the
  Python API of your message schemas
  (`PR#108 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/108>`_)

* No long require "--exchange", "--queue-name", and "--routing-key" to all be
  specified when using "fedora-messaging consume". If one is not supplied, a
  default is chosen. These defaults are documented in the command's manual page
  (`PR#117 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/117>`_)


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix the "consumer" setting in config.toml.example to point to a real Python path
  (`PR#104 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/104>`_)

* fedora-messaging consume now actually uses the --queue-name and --routing-key
  parameter provided to it, and --routing-key can now be specified multiple times
  as was documented
  (`PR#105 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/105>`_)

* Fix the equality check on :class:`fedora_messaging.message.Message` objects to
  exclude the 'sent-at' header
  (`PR#109 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/109>`_)

* Documentation for consumers indicated any callable object was acceptable to use
  as a callback as long as it accepted a single positional argument (the
  message). However, the implementation required that the callable be a function
  or a class, which it then instantiated. This has been fixed and you may now use
  any callable object, such as a method or an instance of a class that implements
  ``__call__``
  (`PR#110 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/110>`_)

* Fix an issue where the fedora-messaging CLI would only log if a configuration
  file was explicitly supplied
  (`PR#113 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/113>`_)

  (`#44 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/44>`_).

* An example consumer that prints to standard output now ships with
  fedora-messaging. It can be used by running ``fedora-messaging consume
  --callback="fedora_messaging.example:printer"``
  (`#40 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/40>`_).

* :class:`fedora_messaging.message.Message` now have a ``severity`` associated with them
  (`#48 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/48>`_).

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix an issue where invalid or missing configuration files resulted in a
  traceback rather than a formatted error message from the CLI (`#21
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/21>`_).

* Client authentication with x509 now works with both the synchronous API and
  the Twisted API (
  `#29 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/29>`_,
  `#35 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/35>`_).

* :func:`fedora_messaging.api.publish` no longer raises a
  :class:`pika.exceptions.ChannelClosed` exception. Instead, it raises a
  :class:`fedora_messaging.exceptions.ConnectionException`
  (`#31 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/31>`_).

* :func:`fedora_messaging.api.consume` is now documented to raise a :class:`ValueError`
  when the callback isn't callable
  (`#47 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/47>`_).


Development Features
--------------------

* The fedora-messaging code base is now compliant with the `Black
  <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ Python formatter and this is enforced with
  continuous integration.

* Test coverage is moving up and to the right.

v1.0.0a1
========

The initial alpha release for fedora-messaging v1.0.0. The API is not expected
to change significantly between this release and the final v1.0.0 release, but
it may do so if serious flaws are discovered in it.
